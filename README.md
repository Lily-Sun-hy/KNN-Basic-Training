# KNN-Basic-Training

This project involves training a KNN classifier on an open-source breast cancer dataset to predict breast cancer detection outcomes. 

Major tasks including exploratory data analysis, data preparation, model training using cross validation, model tuning and model testing. The effect of data standardization on the model performance is also investigated. In the end the model with the best performance is used on an unseen wine dataset to make classifications.
